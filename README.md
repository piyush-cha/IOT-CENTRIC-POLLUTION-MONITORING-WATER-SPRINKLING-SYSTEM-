# PM2.5-LEVEL-DETECTION-WITH-WATER-SPRINKLING-SYSTEM

In this report, we explore the design and implementation of an IoT-centric pollution monitoring and water sprinkling system. The system aims to detect dust pollution using the GP2Y dust sensor, measure water levels with an ultrasonic sensor, and trigger water sprinkling to mitigate pollution. Additionally, the report discusses data processing, cloud integration using ThingWorx, and real-time information display using an LCD screen.
